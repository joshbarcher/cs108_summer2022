INT. COFFEE SHOP â€“ MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that ****.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but -

YOUNG WOMAN
- but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
- yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.
